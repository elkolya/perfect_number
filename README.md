This is a project to determine if a given number
is a perfect number or not.

Basically a number is said to be perfect if only
it's proper factors sum up to the number itself.

Example 1:
To check if Nunber 6 is a perfect number or not.

-Find all factors of 6 which are {1,2,3,6}.

-Determine the proper factors {1,2,3}.

-Add these proper factors
1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

-Since the total sum of the proper numbers give 
us 6, We can say 6 is a perfect number.

Example 2:
To check if Nunber 10 is a perfect number or not.

-Find all factors of 10 which are {1,2,5,10}.

-Determine the proper factors {1,2,5}.

-Add these proper factors
1 + 2 + 5 = 8.

-Since the total sum of the proper numbers give
us 8 and not 10, We can say 10 is not a perfect number.
